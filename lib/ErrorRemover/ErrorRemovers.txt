the errors we got in GridView (i.e the grid boxes in dashboard project):
    they are removed by changing the "childAspectRatio" 

For Example:
1) If the size of screen greater than 1400 than it will adjust with 1.1 and for smaller it will adjust 1.4
 
 // --a value "greater than 1.0" will make cells wider than they are tall,
 // --a value "less than 1.0" will make cells taller than they are wide.

desktop: FileInfoCardGridView(childAspectRatio: _size.width < 1400 ? 1.1 : 1.4,),

2) For mobile screen smalller than 650

mobile: FileInfoCardGridView(

       crossAxisCount: _size.width < 650 ? 2 : 4,
       childAspectRatio: _size.width < 650 ? 1.3 : 1,
                            
                ),
